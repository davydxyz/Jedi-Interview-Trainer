ORIGINAL USER INPUT:
"${originalTranscript}"

MENTOR'S RESPONSE:
"${mentorResponse}"

TASK: Generate 3 strategic follow-up questions that will help the user get deeper, more valuable insights. Consider:

1. GAPS ANALYSIS: What important aspects did the mentor's response NOT fully address?
2. SPECIFICITY OPPORTUNITIES: Where can we push for more concrete examples, metrics, or details?
3. IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS: What practical next steps or real-world application questions would be valuable?
4. CHALLENGE SCENARIOS: What "what if" situations would test their understanding?
5. MENTOR ALIGNMENT: How can we leverage this mentor's strengths (${mentorPersonalities[mentor]})?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "question": "Specific, actionable follow-up question",
      "category": "IMPLEMENTATION|SPECIFICITY|CHALLENGES|DEPTH|SCALE",
      "reasoning": "Why this question adds value"
    }
  ]
}

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Questions should be specific to the context provided
- Each question should unlock different types of insights
- Avoid generic questions that could apply to any situation
- Focus on what would differentiate a junior vs senior response
- Consider the interview level and push for appropriate depth

Generate exactly 3 high-value follow-up questions now:`;
